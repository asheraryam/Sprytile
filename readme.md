### Features

* Tile building: Build your mesh directly with tiles, skip tedious UV mapping while quickly rotating and flipping tiles.
* UV painting: Create your mesh with other Blender tools, then quickly UV map them to your tiles. Spend less time in the UV editor.
* Pixel grid tools: Keep your mesh aligned to the grid with pixel translation, move vertices around with confidence.
